== Bootique Integration with Logback

As mentioned in Bootique https://bootique.io/docs/{bootique_doc_version}/bootique-docs/index.html#_logging[general documentation on logging],
standard modules rely on SLF4J loggers that can be easily bridged to various advanced logging frameworks. Same
maximally neutral logging approach is reasonable to apply in the user modules as well.

https://github.com/bootique/bootique-logback[`bootique-logback`] is a "drag-and-drop" module integrating Bootique
logging with http://logback.qos.ch/[Logback logging framework]. Just like any other module, `bootique-logback` can be
enabled by simply adding it to the `pom.xml` dependencies, assuming `autoLoadModules()` is in effect:

.Maven
[%collapsible%open]
====
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.bootique.logback</groupId>
    <artifactId>bootique-logback</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
====

.Gradle
[%collapsible]
====
[source,groovy]
----
{
  implementation: 'io.bootique.logback:bootique-logback'
}
----
====

Without further configuration it would log everything to console using INFO level. Configuration can be provided via
YAML, as shown in the <<_configuration_reference,Configuration Reference>> section. Configuration options include per
class and package log levels configuration, a choice of appenders, etc.
