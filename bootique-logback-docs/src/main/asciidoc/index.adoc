== Bootique Integration with Logback

As mentioned in Bootique https://bootique.io/docs/{bootique_doc_version}/bootique-docs/index.html#_logging[general documentation on logging], standard modules rely on SLF4J loggers that can be easily bridged to various advanced logging frameworks. Same maximally neutral logging approach is reasonable to apply in the user modules as well.

https://github.com/bootique/bootique-logback[`bootique-logback`] is a "drag-and-drop" module integrating Bootique logging with http://logback.qos.ch/[Logback logging framework]. Just like any other module, `bootique-logback` can be enabled by simply adding it to the `pom.xml` dependencies, assuming `autoLoadModules()` is in effect:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.bootique.logback</groupId>
    <artifactId>bootique-logback</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Without further configuration it would log everything to console using INFO level. Configuration can be provided via YAML, as shown in the following section. Configuration options include per class and package log levels configuration, a choice of appenders, etc.

== Configuration Reference

=== log

[source,yaml]
----
log:
  level: warn
  appenderRefs:
    - test
  loggers:
    com.foo:
      level: debug
      appenderRefs:
        - test
    com.example:
      level: debug
  appenders:
    - type: file
      name: test
      logFormat: '%c{20}: %m%n'
      file: target/logback/testRun_Debug.log
----
"log" is a root element of the Logback configuration and is bound to a https://github.com/bootique/bootique-logback/blob/master/bootique-logback/src/main/java/io/bootique/logback/LogbackContextFactory.java[`LogbackContextFactory`] object. It supports the following properties:

."log" Element Property Reference
[cols=3*,options=header]
|===
|Property
|Default
|Description

|`appenders`
|console appender
|A list of appenders to output logs to. See below.

|`appenderRefs`
|none
|A list of references to appenders. If it's added to child logger only, then the
                         child logger will write logs with this named appender. If the appender added
                         to the root logger, or to both root and child loggers, or none, the appender
                         will be attached to root logger only.

|`level`
|`info`
|A default logging level. Can be overridden per logger.

|`loggers`
|none
|A map of logger factories by logger name. Logger name is a package name (applied recursively) or class name. See below.

|`useLogbackConfig`
|`false`
|If true, all other logback settings are ignored and the user is expected to provide its own config file per http://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html[Logback documentation]. This is only needed for a few advanced options not directly available via Bootique config.
|===

=== log.appenders

[source,yaml]
----
log:
  appenders:
    - type: file
      name: test
      logFormat: '%c{20}: %m%n'
      file: /var/log/myapp.log
    - type: console
      logFormat: '%c{20}: %m%n'
----
Lists appenders to sends the logs to. If the list is empty, console appender is used with default settings. Currently available appenders are "console" and "file":

."console" Appender Property Reference
[cols=3*,options=header]
|===
|Property
|Default
|Description

|`logFormat`
|`%-5p [%d{ISO8601,UTC}] %thread %c{20}: %m%n%rEx`
|A format of the log lines. See Logback http://logback.qos.ch/manual/layouts.html#ClassicPatternLayout[PatternLayout] for details.

|`target`
|`stdout`
|Whether to log to standard output or standard error. Possible values are `stdout` and `stderr`
|===

."file" Appender Property Reference
[cols=3*,options=header]
|===
|Property
|Default
|Description

|`logFormat`
|`%-5p [%d{ISO8601,UTC}] %thread %c{20}: %m%n%rEx`
|A format of the log lines. See Logback http://logback.qos.ch/manual/layouts.html#ClassicPatternLayout[PatternLayout] for details.

|`name`
|none
|The name of the appender. If it has a name it could be added to the loggers by that name. If it has no name it will be automatically added to the root logger.

|`file`
|none
|A name of a file to send the log to.

|`append`
|true
|If true, events are appended at the end of an existing file. Otherwise, if append is false, any existing file is truncated. The append option is set to true by default.

|`rollingPolicy`
|none
|An object that defines a log rotation policy. Examples are given below.
|===

There are a few ways log file rotation can be configured for the "file" appender, as defined by the `rollingPolicy`. Out of the box the following Logback policies are supported: http://logback.qos.ch/manual/appenders.html#FixedWindowRollingPolicy[`fixedWindow`], http://logback.qos.ch/manual/appenders.html#TimeBasedRollingPolicy[`time`], `sizeAndTime`.

==== "fixedWindow" Rolling Policy

[source,yaml]
----
log:
  appenders:
    - type: file
      logFormat: '%c{20}: %m%n'
      file: /var/log/myapp.log
      rollingPolicy:
        type: fixedWindow
        fileNamePattern: '/var/log/myapp-%i.log'
        historySize: 5
        fileSize: 20
----
"fixedWindow" policy rotates the main log file when it reaches a certain size, keeping one or more rotated files.

."fixedWindow" rolling policy Property Reference
[cols=3*,options=header]
|===
|Property
|Default
|Description

|`fileNamePattern`
|none
|A pattern of rotated file name. Must contain `%i` somewhere in the pattern (replaced by a number during rotation).

|`historySize`
|none (unlimited)
|A max number of rotated files to keep.

|`fileSize`
|none
|Max file size that causes rotation. Expressed in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes by suffixing a numeric value with KB, MB and respectively GB. For example: 5000000, 5000KB, 5MB and 2GB.
|===

==== "time" Rolling Policy

[source,yaml]
----
log:
  appenders:
    - type: file
      logFormat: '%c{20}: %m%n'
      file: /var/log/myapp.log
      rollingPolicy:
        type: time
        fileNamePattern: '/var/log/myapp-%d{yyyyMMddHHmmss}.log'
----
"time" policy rotates the main log file at a fixed time interval determined by the file name pattern.

."time" rolling policy Property Reference
[cols=3*,options=header]
|===
|Property
|Default
|Description

|`fileNamePattern`
|none
|A pattern of rotated file name. Its value should consist of the name of the file, plus a suitably placed %d conversion specifier. The %d conversion specifier may contain a date-and-time pattern as specified by the `java.text.SimpleDateFormat` class. If the date-and-time pattern is omitted, then the default pattern `yyyy-MM-dd` is assumed. The rollover interval is inferred from the value of the pattern.

|`historySize`
|none (unlimited)
|A max number of rotated files to keep.

|`totalSize`
|none
|Max size of all log files combined. Expressed in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes by suffixing a numeric value with KB, MB and respectively GB. For example: 5000000, 5000KB, 5MB and 2GB.
|===

==== "sizeAndTime" Rolling Policy

[source,yaml]
----
log:
  appenders:
    - type: file

        type: sizeAndTime
        fileNamePattern: '/var/log/myapp-%d{yyyyMMddHHmmss}.%i.log'
        historySize: 5
        fileSize: 50
        totalSize: 150
----
"sizeAndTime" policy rotates the main log file either at a fixed time interval determined by the file name pattern or when the log file reaches a certain size.

If the date-and-time pattern is omitted, then the default pattern `yyyy-MM-dd` is assumed. The rollover interval is inferred from the value of the pattern.

|`historySize`
|none (unlimited)
|A max number of rotated files to keep.
